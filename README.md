## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite.js](https://vite.dev/) - JS/React library
- [Styled Components with Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I have learned how to set up the Bootstrap settings with the vite.js framkework. Bootstrap will not use the styling from the vite.js framework. It will need to be installed separetly with the configuration by creating scss directory and changes in the vite.config.js file

Teh full intrcution can be found under the following link:

- [Bootstrap Setup](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/vite/#setup)

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Styling](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/overview/) - This helped me for styling of the proejct and how to use the it. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
